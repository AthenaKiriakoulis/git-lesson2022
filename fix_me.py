#Number 15, Burger King Foot Lettuce
#The last thing you want on your Burger King burger is someone's 
#foot fungus, but as it turns out, that might be what you get. 
#A 4channer uploaded a photo anonymously to the site showcasing his feet in a plastic bin of lettuce, 
#with the statement: "This is the lettuce you eat at Burger King." Admittedly, he had shoes on but, that's even worse.
#The post went live at 11:38PM on July 16 and a mere 20 minutes later, the Burger King in question was alerted to the rogue employee. 
#at least, I hope he's rogue. How did it happen? Well, the BK employee hadn't removed the Exif data from the uploaded photo, 
#which suggested the culprit was somewhere in Mayfield Heights, Ohio. This was at 11:47. 3 minutes later, at 11:50, 
#the Burger King branch address was posted, with wishes of happy unemployment. 5 minutes later, the news station was contacted
#by another 4channer. And 3 minutes later, at 11:58, a link was posted. Bk's "Tell Us About US" online form. 
#The foot photo otherwise known as Exhibit A, was attached. Cleveland Scene Magazine contacted the BK in question the next day. When questioned, 
#the breakfast shift manager said, "Oh, I know who that is. He's getting fired."
#Mystery, Solved, by 4chan, now we can all go back to eating our fast food in peace.
